#### Non-increasing subsequence
Write a program that, for a given sequence, finds its maximum non-increasing subsequence (that is, such a sequence of numbers $a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, ..., a_{i_k}\ (i_1 < i_2 < ... < i_k)$ that $a_{i_1} \ge a_{i_2} \ge ... \ge a_{i_k}$ and there is no sequence with the same properties of length $k+1$).
