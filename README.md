#### Peaceful Sets 

A group of mathematicians is conducting battles between natural numbers. The outcome of a battle between two natural numbers is generally random, but it follows this rule: if one number is at least twice as large as the other, then the larger number always wins; otherwise, either number can win.

A battle is considered uninteresting if its outcome can be predicted. A set of natural numbers is considered peaceful if any battle between two different numbers in the set is uninteresting. The strength of a set is the sum of the numbers in it. How many peaceful sets of natural numbers with a strength of n exist?
